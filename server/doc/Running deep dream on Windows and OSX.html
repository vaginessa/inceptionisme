            <p>A few days ago, Google released a <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com.au/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html">Python Notebook</a> to let you play with some of their very recent <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">work on visualisation</a> with neural networks.</p>

<p>Despite being designed to rely on as few dependancies as possible, a 
recurring complaint I saw is that it's so difficult for non-programmers 
to set up and start playing with.</p>

<p>If that sounds like you, then you're in luck! I've built and packaged
 a complete virtual environment, with all dependancies included &amp; 
ready to go. We can do the entire thing from scratch in a few lines at 
the terminal (after chewing through a few GB of bandwidth). The tool is 
called Docker, and the virtual environments are called Containers. What 
we're going to do is install Docker, pull my deepdream container, and 
run the container so we can play with the tool in our web-browser.</p>

<p>I'm on a mac, so the guide will follow that. If you're on Linux, you 
know what to do. If you're on Windows, most things should still work, 
but you'll need to apply this guide to your environment. I haven't used 
Windows properly in ~5 years, so I can't provide much help (Boot2docker 
is available on Windows, so the steps should be extremely similar).</p>

<p><strong>First</strong> you'll need <code>Docker</code> - a tool to 
let you easily use pre-packaged virtual computers on your own computer. 
To get a good understanding of what we're actually doing, you should 
read the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/">installation guide</a>. Or if you just want to speed through and get to the cool stuff -</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases/tag/v1.7.0">boot2docker installer</a> and run it.</li>
<li>Open <code>Boot2docker</code> by searching for it in Spotlight (âŒ˜ + space)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should have something like this now <br>
<img src="Running%20deep%20dream%20on%20Windows%20and%20OSX_files/Screen-Shot-2015-07-04-at-8-17-38-am.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Second</strong> you'll need to get the Docker container somehow. The easiest way to do this is to run <code>docker pull ryankennedyio/deepdream</code> at the terminal we've now got open. This is about 3GB, so go and get a coffee (or three). </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can get the source from <a href="https://github.com/ryankennedyio/deep-dream-generator">Github</a> by downloading as a Zip, extractive, navigating the <code>boot2docker</code> terminal window to that location and executing <code>docker build -t ryankennedy/deepdream .</code> to build the image yourself</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong> you need to 'boot' the container. This is done with </p>

<pre><code>docker run -d -p 443:8888 -e "PASSWORD=password" -v /path/to/this/repository:/src ryankennedyio/deepdream
</code></pre>

<p><em>Special note:</em> <code>path/to/this/repository</code> should be the location where you want to play with input images. In my case, that would be <code>/Users/ryankennedy/Pictures</code>. This directory is being shared with the Docker container, so that you can access your input pictures.</p>

<p><strong>Finally</strong> enter <code>boot2docker ip</code> at the terminal. Copy and paste it, and enter <code>https://&lt;that-ip-address&gt;</code> into your browser (don't miss the http<strong>s</strong>). You'll get some warnings about an unsafe connection, but that's OK. Enter <code>password</code> when prompted for it.</p>

<p>If we've done everything right until this point, we should now see this. <br>
<img src="Running%20deep%20dream%20on%20Windows%20and%20OSX_files/Screen-Shot-2015-07-04-at-8-44-34-am.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Click <code>dream.ipynb</code> to start Google's python notebook. You might get <code>Failed to retrieve MathJax from ...</code> popup, but that's OK.</p>

<h5 id="nowwhat">Now what?</h5>

<p>Python Notebooks are an interactive way to play with code in a more 
beginner-friendly manner (I may have just offended the entire scientific
 Python community with that).</p>

<p>Click on a code block and press the play button at the top. The <code>In[*]</code>
 on the left indicates that this code block is currently running. When 
the * turns into a number, the code has finished and you're ready to do 
the next one.</p>

<p>When you run this code block</p>

<pre><code>img = np.float32(PIL.Image.open('/src/input.jpg'))
showarray(img)
</code></pre>

<p>the file named <code>input.jpg</code> will be shown. You can edit the code just by double clicking, should you want to change the input image. </p>

<p>If you start getting errors like <code>IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/src/input.jpg'</code>, then you didn't correctly mount the shared folder to the docker container in the <strong>third</strong> step. It's important to note that the <code>/path/to/this/repository</code> part in the <code>run</code> command will be shared to the docker container, and the docker container can access this using <code>/src</code>.</p>

<p>The generation may take a little while, but you can see it updating in real time, each iteration over the image.</p>

<p>For an explanation of what's actually happening here, I'd encourage you to read the <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">google research blog post</a>. There's a really nice gallery <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/fFcivHZ2CDhqCkZdA">here</a>, and of course following the #deepdream tag on your <del>choice of poison</del> favourite social network.</p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<p><strong>No such directory or canâ€™t find folder.</strong> Because 
weâ€™re essentially working in a VM within a VM, (docker inside 
boot2docker), your host folder needs to be available to boot2docker. By 
default, only folders inside /Users/ will work, because boot2docker will
 mount /Users/ when itâ€™s first installed.</p>

<p>For example, on Windows you'd want to do something like <code>//c/Users/me/pictures:/src/</code> as the parameter to the <code>-v</code> option.</p>

<p>To see what's actually mounted at <code>/src</code> when the VM is running, do the following in boot2docker.</p>

<p><code>docker ps</code> - then find the 'NAME' of the current container (something weird, like 'insane_babbage' for example).</p>

<p><code>docker exec -it insane_babbage bash</code> will launch you into terminal <em>inside</em> the container. Once inside, <code>ls /src</code>
 will show you the contents of the directory that you've mounted. This 
should give you a clue as to which folder been mounted to the container 
(if anything).</p>

<p><strong>WebSocket connection failed.</strong> Apparently will happen on OSX with Safari. Try with firefox or chrome.</p>

<p><strong>Cannot start container [...] Bind for 0.0.0.0:443 failed: port is already allocated.</strong>
You'll be getting this error because you have a program already running 
on port 443 (the HTTPS default port). The most common case would be that
 you already have a container running, and you're trying to run another 
one. Two containers cannot run at the same time, on the same port. 
Either try to use 4430 instead of 443 (or any number above 1024), or do <code>docker ps</code> and <code>docker stop &lt;container-name&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;container name&gt;</code> is something like 'insane_babbage'.</p>

<p><strong>Restarting the container.</strong> You may deem it necessary to restart the container, if the kernel locks up or the whole app becomes unresponsive. In <code>boot2docker</code>, just stop the container (as explained in the above paragraph) and restart it with the <code>run</code> (step 3) command again.</p>

<p><strong>If all else fails...</strong> A lot of the issues I've seen 
are due to unfamiliarity with Docker. That's expected, since it's a very
 new tool - and while it has had explosive popularity in the engineering
 world, it's no surprise that you might not have used it yet. Try to 
spend 20 minutes running through the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/userguide/">introduction tutorials</a>.</p>

<h3 id="goingfurther">Going Further</h3>

<p><strong>Different Models.</strong> The default 'puppy-slug' model might be boring you by now. Great! I only included the bvlc_googlenet container by default. </p>

<p>You will need to download the models from <a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models">BVLC's repository</a>.
 If you go into any of the model folders, there is a link to download 
the model file (models are not included in the repository). Make sure to
 download deploy.prototxt from each of those directories too.</p>

<p>Create a new folder for each model you want to play with, and download the <code>.caffemodel</code> and <code>deploy.prototxt</code>
 into that model's folder. Make sure those folders are inside the shared
 directory you're mounting, and access them by editing the python block:</p>

<pre><code>model_path = '../caffe/models/bvlc_googlenet/' # substitute your path here
net_fn   = model_path + 'deploy.prototxt'
param_fn = model_path + 'bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel'
</code></pre>

<p>to be something like </p>

<pre><code>model_path = '/src/&lt;model-folder-here&gt;/' # substitute your path here
net_fn   = model_path + 'deploy.prototxt'
param_fn = model_path + '&lt;put-model-name-here&gt;.caffemodel'
</code></pre>

<p>(Don't miss the '/' on the end of model_path).</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Containers.</strong> The team at <a href="http://vision.ai/">vision.ai</a> have produced another container <a href="https://github.com/VISIONAI/clouddream">available here</a>.
 You might need to be a little more comfortable with programming to 
follow along, but the result is a website running locally, like <a href="http://deepdream.vision.ai/">http://deepdream.vision.ai/</a></p>
