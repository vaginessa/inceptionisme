Quick for initial:

cordova platform remove ios
->make name of the app without blanks in cordova config.xml
cordova platform add ios

and only these two for later iterations after android changes:
cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-ad-adcolony
cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-admobpro
- and google play services?

- change app name in XCode "build settings" to InceptionisME (cause motherfucking apple won't allow it to be named Deep Dream)
- change package to full


TODO:
- dont mention buyin on ios
- invervals pile up

known bugs:
- images not visible in list after restart 
	- only if started from xcode.


----------------
explanations:
- make sure project path has no blank in it. might be part of the problem with header files not found…
	- this actually needs to be done before project start, when generating cordova project.
		
	——> make name of the app without blanks in cordova config.xml. later rename it back after “cordova platform add ios”
		-> apparently that is not even needed! the important thing is to “cordova platform add ios” on the OS X directly.

—> just disable motherfucking AdMob and AdColony plugins for building ios

-> install Xcode 6.4 command line tools for newest GCC and clang: 
	Commandline tool was installed with: xcode-select --install

	all this shit below is just because blank in project name
————————————————————————————


- open Xcode project from platforms/ios folder

- replace Q with q: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28898012/cordova-4-3-0-build-command-returns-error-cannot-find-module-q
	- grep -rl "require('Q" * | xargs sed -i "" "s/'Q'/'q'/g";

- extract headers from AdColony.framework into AdColony Folder

- in Xcode add AdColony and AdMob frameworks to linked packages in build phase settings, even if they are already in the list.

- extract headers GoogleMobileAds.framework into GoogleMobileAds Folder

- remove GoogleMobileAds folder in paths of all imports in GoogleMobileAds.h
like this:
- replace all <> with “” in imports in the AdMob header files
